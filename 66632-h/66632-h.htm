</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This book is intended as a practical guide to the game of Go. It is especially designed
to assist students of the game who have acquired a smattering of it in some way and
who wish to investigate it further at their leisure.
</p>
<p>As far as I know there is no work in the English language on the game of Go as played
in Japan. There is an article on the Chinese game by Z. Volpicelli, in Vol. XXVI of
the “Journal of the China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.” This article I have
not consulted. There is also a short description of the Japanese game in a work on
“Korean Games with Notes on the Corresponding Games of China and Japan,” by Stewart
Culin, but this description would be of little practical use in learning to play the
game.
</p>
<p>There is, however, an exhaustive treatise on the game in German by O. Korschelt. This
can be found in Parts 21–24 of the “<span lang="de">Mittheilungen der deutschen Gesellschaft für Natur- und Völkerkunde Ostasiens.</span>” The student could readily learn the game from Herr Korschelt’s article if it were
available, but his work has not been translated, and it is obtainable only in a few
libraries in this country. In the preparation of this book I have borrowed freely
from Herr Korschelt’s work, especially in the chapter devoted to the history of the
game, and I have also adopted many of his illustrative games and problems.
</p>
<p>Herr Korschelt was an excellent player, and acquired <span class="pageNum" id="pb.vi">[<a href="#pb.vi">vi</a>]</span>his knowledge of the game from Murase Shuho, who was the best player in Japan at the
time his article was written (about 1880).
</p>
<p>My acquaintance with the game has been acquired from Mr. Mokichi Nakamura, a Japanese
resident of this country, who is an excellent player, and whose enthusiasm for the
game led me to attempt this book. Mr. Nakamura has also supplied much of the material
which I have used in it. Toward the end I have had the expert assistance of Mr. Jihei
Hashiguchi, with whom readers of the <i>New York Sun</i> are already acquainted.
</p>
<p>Wherever possible I have given the Japanese words and phrases which are used in playing
the game, and for those who are not familiar with the system of writing Japanese with
Roman characters, I may say that the consonants have the sounds used in English, and
the vowels the sounds that are used in Italian, all the final vowels being sounded.
Thus, “dame” is pronounced as though spelled “dahmay.”

<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The game of Go belongs to the class of games of which our Chess, though very dissimilar,
is an example. It is played on a board, and is a game of pure skill, into which the
element of chance does not enter; moreover, it is an exceedingly difficult game to
learn, and no one can expect to acquire the most superficial knowledge of it without
many hours of hard work. It is said in Japan that a player with ordinary aptitude
for the game would have to play ten thousand games in order to attain professional
rank of the lowest degree. When we think that it would take twenty-seven years to
play ten thousand games at the rate of one game per day, we can get some idea of the
Japanese estimate of its difficulty. The difficulty of the game and the remarkable
amount of time and labor which it is necessary to expend in order to become even a
moderately good player, are the reasons why Go has not spread to other countries since
Japan has been opened to foreign intercourse. For the same reasons few foreigners
who live there have become familiar with it.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, its intense interest is attested by the following saying of the
Japanese: “<span lang="ja-latn">Go uchi wa oya no shini me ni mo awanu</span>,” which means that a man playing the game would not leave off even to be present
at the death-bed of a parent. I have found that beginners in this country to whom
I have shown the game always seem to find it interesting, although so far I have known
no one who has <span class="pageNum" id="pb.viii">[<a href="#pb.viii">viii</a>]</span>progressed beyond the novice stage. The more it is played the more its beauties and
opportunities for skill become apparent, and it may be unhesitatingly recommended
to that part of the community, however small it may be, for whom games requiring skill
and patience have an attraction.
</p>
<p>It is natural to compare it with our Chess, and it may safely be said that Go has
nothing to fear from the comparison. Indeed, it is not too much to say that it presents
even greater opportunities for foresight and keen analysis.
</p>
<p>The Japanese also play Chess, which they call “Shogi,” but it is slightly different
from our Chess, and their game has not been so well developed.
</p>
<p>Go, on the other hand, has been zealously played and scientifically developed for
centuries, and as will appear more at length in the chapter on the History of the
Game, it has, during part of this time, been recognized and fostered by the government.
Until recently a systematic treatment of the game, such as we are accustomed to in
our books on Chess, has been lacking in Japan. A copious literature had been produced,
but it consisted mostly of collections of illustrative and annotated games, and the
Go masters seem to have had a desire to make their marginal annotations as brief as
possible, in order to compel the beginner to go to the master for instruction and
to learn the game only by hard practice.
</p>
<p>Chess and Go are both in a sense military games, but the military tactics that are
represented in Chess are of a past age, in which the king himself entered the conflict—his
fall generally meaning the loss of the battle—and in which the victory or defeat was
brought about by the courage <span class="pageNum" id="pb.ix">[<a href="#pb.ix">xi</a>]</span>of single noblemen rather than through the fighting of the common soldiers.
</p>
<p>Go, on the other hand, is not merely a picture of a single battle like Chess, but
of a whole campaign of a modern kind, in which the strategical movements of the masses
in the end decide the victory. Battles occur in various parts of the board, and sometimes
several are going on at the same time. Strong positions are besieged and captured,
and whole armies are cut off from their line of communications and are taken prisoners
unless they can fortify themselves in impregnable positions, and a far-reaching strategy
alone assures the victory.
</p>
<p>It is difficult to say which of the two games gives more pleasure. The combinations
in Go suffer in comparison with those of Chess by reason of a certain monotony, because
there are no pieces having different movements, and because the stones are not moved
again after once being placed on the board. Also to a beginner the play, especially
in the beginning of the game, seems vague; there are so many points on which the stones
may be played, and the amount of territory obtainable by one move or the other seems
hopelessly indefinite. This objection is more apparent than real, and as one’s knowledge
of the game grows, it becomes apparent that the first stones must be played with great
care, and that there are certain definite, advantageous positions, which limit the
player in his choice of moves, just as the recognized Chess openings guide our play
in that game. Stones so played in the opening are called “Joseki” by the Japanese.
Nevertheless, I think that in the early part of the game the play is somewhat indefinite
for any player of ordinary skill. On the other <span class="pageNum" id="pb.x">[<a href="#pb.x">x</a>]</span>hand, these considerations are balanced by the greater number of combinations and
by the greater number of places on the board where conflicts take place. As a rule
it may be said that two average players of about equal strength will find more pleasure
in Go than in Chess, for in Chess it is almost certain that the first of two such
players who loses a piece will lose the game, and further play is mostly an unsuccessful
struggle against certain defeat. In Go, on the other hand, a severe loss does not
by any means entail the loss of the game, for the player temporarily worsted can betake
himself to another portion of the field where, for the most part unaffected by the
reverse already suffered, he may gain a compensating advantage.
</p>
<p>A peculiar charm of Go lies in the fact that through the so-called “Ko” an apparently
severe loss may often be made a means of securing a decisive advantage in another
portion of the board. A game is so much the more interesting the oftener the opportunities
for victory or defeat change, and in Chess these chances do not change often, seldom
more than twice. In Go, on the other hand, they change much more frequently, and sometimes
just at the end of the game, perhaps in the last moments, an almost certain defeat
may by some clever move be changed into a victory.
</p>
<p>There is another respect in which Go is distinctly superior to Chess. That is in the
system of handicapping. When handicaps are given in Chess, the whole opening is more
or less spoiled, and the scale of handicaps, from the Bishop’s Pawn to Queen’s Rook,
is not very accurate; and in one variation of the Muzio gambit, so far from being
a handicap, it is really an advantage to the first player to give <span class="pageNum" id="pb.xi">[<a href="#pb.xi">xi</a>]</span>up the Queen’s Knight. In Go, on the other hand, the handicaps are in a progressive
scale of great accuracy, they have been given from the earliest times, and the openings
with handicaps have been studied quite as much as those without handicaps.
</p>
<p>In regard to the time required to play a game of Go, it may be said that ordinary
players finish a game in an hour or two, but as in Chess, a championship game may
be continued through several sittings, and may last eight or ten hours. There is on
record, however, an authentic account of a game that was played for the championship
at Yeddo during the Shogunate, which lasted continuously nine days and one night.
</p>
<p>Before taking up a description of the board and stones and the rules of play, we will
first outline a history of the game.

<h2 class="label">I</h2>
<h2 class="main">HISTORY OF THE GAME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The game of Go is probably the oldest of all known games. It was played by the Chinese
from earliest antiquity, and has been played in its present form by the Japanese for
over eleven centuries, but while the game originated in China, the Japanese have far
surpassed the Chinese in skill at the game, and it has come to be regarded in Japan
as their national game.
</p>
<p>In the old Chinese works three persons are named as the originators of the game, but
in Japan its invention is commonly attributed to only one of these. This man is the
Chinese emperor Shun, who reigned from 2255 to 2206 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> It is said that this emperor invented the game in order to strengthen the weak mind
of his son Shang Kiun. By others the invention of the game is attributed to the predecessor
of Shun, the emperor Yao, who reigned from 2357 to 2256 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> If this theory is correct it would make the game about forty-two hundred years old.
The third theory is that Wu, a vassal of the Chinese emperor Kieh Kwei (1818–1767
<span class="asc">B.C.</span>) invented the game of Go. To the same man is often attributed the invention of games
of cards. It would seem that this last theory is the most credible, because it would
make the invention more recent, and because the inventor is said to have been a vassal
and not an emperor.
</p>
<p>Whatever may be the truth in regard to the origin of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>game, it is perfectly certain that Go was already known in China in early antiquity.
In old Chinese works, of which the oldest is dated about a thousand years before Christ,
a game which can be easily recognized as Go is mentioned casually, so that at that
time it must have been well known.
</p>
<p>We are told also that in China somewhere about 200 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, poetry and Go went hand in hand, and were in high favor, and a poet, Bayu, who lived
about the year 240 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, made himself famous through poems in which he sang the praises of the game.
</p>
<p>It is remarkable that in the old books it is stated that in the year 300 <span class="asc">A.D.</span> a man by the name of Osan was so skilled in Go that he could take all the stones
from the board after the game had been finished and then play it over from memory.
This is of interest also as showing that in the course of time playing the game has
had the effect of strengthening the memory of Go players, because there are now hundreds
of players in Japan who can replace a game move for move after it has been disarranged.
It is in fact the customary thing for a teacher of the game to play the game over
in that way in order to criticise the moves made by the student.
</p>
<p>Anecdotes have come down to us from the old Chinese times in regard to the game, of
which we will mention only one, which shows how highly it was esteemed.
</p>
<p>Sha An, a man who lived in the time of the Tsin Dynasty (265–419 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), carried on a war with his nephew Sha Gen. Growing tired of taking life, they left
the victory to be decided by a game of Go, which they played against each other.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>The esteem in which players were held in the old Chinese times is also shown by the
titles with which they were honored; to wit, “Kisei” or “Ki Shing,” from “Ki,” meaning
Go, and “Sei,” a holy man, and “Shing,” magician or sage.
</p>
<p>In the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–906 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), and again during the Sung Dynasty (960–1126 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), the first books about Go were written. The game then flourished in China, and there
were then many distinguished players in that country.
</p>
<p>According to the Japanese reckoning of time, Go was introduced into Japan in the period
Tem pyo, during the reign of the emperor Shomu, which according to the Chinese records
was the thirteenth year of the period Tien Tao, and during the reign of the emperor
Huan Tsung. According to our calendar this would be about the year 735 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>
</p>
<p>A man otherwise well known in the history of Japan, Kibi Daijin, was sent as an envoy
to China in that year, and it is said that he brought the game back with him to Japan.
</p>
<p>Go may have been known in Japan before that date, but at any rate it must have been
known about this time, for in the seventh month of the tenth year of the period Tem
pyo (<span class="asc">A.D.</span> 738), we are told that a Japanese nobleman named Kumoshi was playing Go with another
nobleman named Adzumabito, and that in a quarrel resulting from the game Kumoshi killed
Adzumabito with his sword.
</p>
<p>On its introduction into Japan a new era opened in the development of the game, but
at first it spread very slowly, and it is mentioned a hundred years later that the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>number of Go players among the nobility (and to them the knowledge of the game was
entirely confined) was very small indeed.
</p>
<p>In the period called Kasho (848–851 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), and in Nin Ju (851–854 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>), a Japanese prince dwelt in China, and was there taught the game by the best player
in China. The following anecdote is told in regard to this prince: that in order to
do him honor the Chinese allowed him to meet the best players, and in order to cope
with them he hit upon the idea of placing his stones exactly in the same way as those
of his opponent; that is to say, when his opponent placed a stone at any point, he
would place his stone on a point symmetrically opposite, and in that way he is said
to have won. In regard to this anecdote it may be said that the Chinese must have
been very weak players, or they would speedily have found means of overcoming this
method of defense.
</p>
<p>We next hear that in the year 850 a Japanese named Wakino became famous as a great
devotee of the game. He played continuously day and night, and became so engrossed
in the game that he forgot everything else absolutely.
</p>
<p>In the next two centuries the knowledge of the game did not extend beyond the court
at Kioto. Indeed, it appears that it was forbidden to play Go anywhere else than at
court. At all events we are told that in the period called Otoku (1084–1087 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>) the Prince of Dewa, whose name was Kiowara no Mahira, secretly introduced the game
into the province of Oshu, and played there with his vassals. From that time not only
the number of the nobility who played the game increased rapidly, but the common people
as well began to take it up.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our frontispiece illustrates an incident which is said to have occurred about this
time in the city of Kamakura. A samurai named Sato Tadanobu, who was a vassal of Yoshitsune,
a brother of Yoritomo, the first Shogun of Japan, was playing Go in his house when
he was suddenly attacked by his enemies, and he is depicted using the “Goban” as a
weapon wherewith to defend himself. The print is by Kuniyoshi, and is one of a series
the title of which might be translated as “Our Favorite Hero Series.” The “<span lang="ja-latn">Go ban</span>,” “<span lang="ja-latn">Go ishi</span>,” and “<span lang="ja-latn">Go tsubo</span>” look precisely like those which are at present in use, but Kuniyoshi probably represented
the type in use in his day and not in the time of Yoritomo, as it is pretty well settled
that in the early times the board was smaller.
</p>
<p>There is also a story which comes down from the Kamakura period in regard to Hojo
Yoshitoki. He is said to have been playing Go with a guest at the moment that news
arrived of the uprising of Wada Yoshimori. Yoshitoki is said to have first finished
the game in perfect calmness before he thought of his measures for subduing the revolution.
This was in the first year of Kempo, or 1213 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century we find that Go was widely known in the
samurai class, and was played with zeal. At that time everybody who went to war, from
the most famous general down to the meanest soldier, played the game. The board and
stones were carried with them to the field of battle, and as soon as the battle was
over, they were brought out, and the friendly strife began. Many of the monks and
poets of that period also had a taste for Go, and several of them are mentioned as
celebrated Go players.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span></p>
<p>All three of the great Japanese generals, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Iyeyasu, were devotees
of the game. It is related that Nobunaga came to Kioto in the tenth year of Ten Sho,
1582 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>, and lived in the Honnoji Temple. One night the celebrated Go player, Sansha, of
whom more hereafter, came and played with him until midnight. Sansha had scarcely
taken his departure when the uprising of Akechi Mitsuhide broke out.
</p>
<p>In the periods Genki (1570–1572), Ten Sho (1573–1591) until Keicho (1596–1614), and
Gen Wa (1615–1623), there were many celebrated players among the monks, poets, farmers
and tradespeople. They were called to the courts of the daimios and to the halls of
the nobles, either in order that the nobility might play with them, or more frequently
merely to exhibit their skill at the game. This custom existed up to the time of the
fall of the Shogunate.
</p>
<p>That the Japanese could find pleasure in merely watching a game that is so abstract
in its nature and so difficult to understand is evidence of the fact that they were
then a highly cultivated people intellectually. We find nothing like it in this country
except in the narrowest Chess circles.
</p>
<p>In the beginning of the seventeenth century Go attained such a high development that
there appeared a series of expert players who far surpassed anything known before.
Of these the most famous were Honinbo Sansha Hoin, Nakamura Doseki, Hayashi Rigen,
Inouye Inseki, and Yasui Santetsu.
</p>
<p>Sansha was the son of a merchant of Kioto. When he was nine years old he shaved his
head, named himself Nikkai, and became a Buddhist monk in the Temple of Shokokuji,
which was one of the principal temples of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>Nichi Ren sect in Kioto. From his early life Sansha was very skilful at the game,
and upon giving up his profession as a monk, he obtained permission to institute a
school of Go players, and he then took the name of Honinbo Sansha. He was on terms
of familiar intercourse with Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Iyeyasu, often accompanied them
on their travels and campaigns, and was present at many of the battles of that troublous
epoch.
</p>
<p>The school of Go which Honinbo opened, however, was merely a private undertaking.
The first State institution in which Go was taught was founded by Hideyoshi in the
period Ten Sho (1573–1591), but it seems to have had a short existence, and the permanent
institution which lasted until the fall of the Shogunate was founded by the successor
of Hideyoshi, Iyeyasu. Iyeyasu became Shogun in the year 1603, and the foundation
of the Go Academy or “<span lang="ja-latn">Go In</span>,” as the Japanese call it, must have occurred soon after he ascended the throne.
Honinbo Sansha, who was still the best Go player in Japan, was named as the head of
the institution. The other most skilful masters were installed as professors with
good salaries. To Honinbo Sansha, the director, was given 350 tsubo of land (a tsubo
is as big as two Japanese mats or tatami, and is therefore six feet square), and an
annual revenue of 200 koku of rice (a koku is a little more than five bushels). Men
of the best intelligence could now dedicate themselves to the education of students
and the further development of the game, freed from the cares of earning a livelihood.
In both respects the institute was eminently successful. Its graduates were much more
skilful than the previous generation of Go players living in the land. They devoted
themselves entirely <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>to the game, and either found positions as players at the court of a daimio, or traveled
through the country (like the poets and swordsmen of that period), playing the game
and giving instruction in its mysteries as they found opportunity. If they came to
a place which pleased them, they often let their years of wandering come to an end
and remained there, making their living as teachers of the game.
</p>
<p>At the time of the founding of the Academy, besides Honinbo, the previously mentioned
masters, Hayashi, Inouye, and Yasui, were installed as professors. For some reason,
Nakamura, who is mentioned above as one of the contemporaries of Honinbo, did not
appear at the Academy. Each of the four masters above named founded his school or
method of play independently of the others, and the custom existed that each teacher
adopted his best pupil as a son, and thus had a successor at his death; so the teachers
in the Academy were always named Honinbo, Inouye, Hayashi, and Yasui. (Lovers of Japanese
prints are already familiar with this continued similarity of names.)
</p>
<p>The best players of the Academy had to appear every year before the Shogun and play
for his amusement. This ceremony was called “<span lang="ja-latn">Go zen Go</span>,” which means “playing the game in the august presence,” or “<span lang="ja-latn">O shiro Go</span>,” “<span lang="ja-latn">Shiro</span>” meaning “the honorable palace,” and the masters of the game entered these contests
with the same determination that was displayed by the samurai on the field of battle.
</p>
<p>An anecdote has come down to us from the reign of the third Shogun, Tokugawa Iyemitsu,
showing how highly the Go masters regarded their art. At that time Yasui Sanchi was
“Meijin,” which, as we shall see in a moment, meant the highest rank in the Go world,
while Honinbo <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>Sanyetsu held the rank of “<span lang="ja-latn">Jo zu</span>,” which was almost as high, but which, according to the rules, would entitle him
to a handicap of one stone from his expert adversary; and these two men, being the
best players, were selected to play in the Shogun’s presence. Honinbo, feeling conscious
of his skill, disdained to accept the handicap, and met his adversary on even terms.
The game was proceeding in the presence of the court nobles before the Shogun had
appeared, and among the spectators was Matsudaira Higo no Kami, one of the most powerful
noblemen of that epoch. Yasui Sanchi was a favorite of Matsudaira and as he watched
the play he remarked audibly that Honinbo would surely be defeated. Honinbo Sanyetsu
heard the remark, and pausing in his play, he allowed the stone which he was about
to place on the board to fall back into the “<span lang="ja-latn">Go tsubo</span>” or wooden jar that holds the Go stones, gently covered the “<span lang="ja-latn">Go tsubo</span>,” and drawing himself up with great dignity, said: “I am serving the Shogun with
the art of Go, and when we Go masters enter a contest, it is in the same spirit as
warriors go upon the field of battle, staking our life, if necessary, to decide the
contest. While we are doing this we do not allow interference or comments from any
one, no matter how high may be his rank. Although I am not the greatest master of
the game, I hold the degree of ‘<span lang="ja-latn">Jo zu</span>,’ and, therefore, there are few players in Japan who are able to appreciate my plans,
tactics, or strategy. Nevertheless, the Prince of Higo has unwarrantedly prophesied
my defeat. I do not understand why he has done this, but if such a comment were allowed
to become a precedent, and onlookers were permitted to make whatever comments on the
game they saw fit, it would be better <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>that the custom of the ‘<span lang="ja-latn">O shiro Go</span>’ should cease.” Having said this, he raised himself from his seat. At this moment
the court officers announced the coming of the Shogun, and the noblemen who had assembled
to see the contest, surprised and confused by the turn affairs had taken, earnestly
persuaded Honinbo to reseat himself and continue the game. This he obstinately refused
to do, and endeavored to leave the imperial chamber. Prince Matsudaira, taken aback,
scarcely knew what to do. However, he kotowed to Honinbo and, profusely apologizing,
besought the offended master to finish the contest. Honinbo Sanyetsu was appeased,
and resumed his seat at the board, and both players, aroused by the incident, exerted
every effort to achieve victory. Honinbo Sanyetsu won, whereupon the Prince of Higo
was greatly humiliated. Since then the name of Sanyetsu has always been revered as
one of the greatest of the Honinbo family.
</p>
<p>In the degenerate days toward the end of the Tokugawa Dynasty the “Go zen Go” became
a mere farce, and the games were all played through and studied out beforehand, in
order that the ceremony in court might not last too long. The custom was, however,
maintained until the fall of the Shogunate in 1868.
</p>
<p>Honinbo Sansha established at the time of the foundation of the Academy a method of
classifying the players by giving them degrees, which still exists, although no longer
under the authority of the State. When a man attained to a certain measure of skill
in the game he received the title “Shodan,” or, of the first degree. The still stronger
players were arranged as “Nidan,” “Sandan,” “Yodan,” etc., or of the second, third,
and fourth degrees. The highest <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>degree in the series was “Kudan,” or the ninth degree. In order to attain the first
degree, or “Shodan,” the candidate must be an excellent player, so good in fact that
he could follow the game as a profession. In other games such a graduated system of
classifying players would be scarcely possible, but among good Go players it is feasible,
because the better player almost invariably wins, even if he be but slightly superior.
If the difference in skill could not be equalized in some way the game would become
tiresome, as the weaker player would almost always be able to foresee his defeat.
The stronger player, therefore, allows his adversary to place enough stones on the
board as a handicap to make the adversaries approximately equal.
</p>
<p>According to the rules of the Academy, if the difference between the skill of the
players was only one degree, the weaker player would be allowed the first move. If
the difference was two degrees, the weaker player would be allowed to place a stone
on the board, and the stronger player would have the first move, and so on; in other
words, the difference between each degree might be called half a stone. Thus, a player
of the fourth degree would allow a player of the first degree to place two stones
on the board as a handicap, but would have the first move. A player of the seventh
degree would allow a player of the first degree three stones, and a player of the
ninth degree would allow a player of the first degree four stones. Four was the highest
handicap allowed among the players holding degrees, but, as we shall see later, among
players of less skill greater handicaps are frequently given.
</p>
<p>A player of the seventh degree also received the honorary title “Jo zu,” or the higher
hand. Those of the eighth <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>rank were called “Kan shu,” or the half-way step, and those of the ninth degree were
called “Mei shu,” the clear, bright hand, or “Mei jin,” literally “celebrated man.”
It is related that this last appellation arose in the time of Nobunaga, who was a
spectator of a game played by Honinbo Sansha with some contemporary, and who expressed
his admiration of the skill of Honinbo by exclaiming “Mei jin!” which thus became
the title applied to players of the highest skill.
</p>
<p>Since the institution of this method of classifying Go players over three hundred
years ago, there have been only nine players who have attained the ninth degree, and
only fourteen players who have attained the eighth degree. On the other hand, there
have been many more of the seventh, and many more still of each of the lower degrees.
In 1880, at the time Korschelt wrote the article previously referred to, there was
only one player in Japan holding the seventh degree, and that was the celebrated Murase
Shuho. At present there is one player who holds the ninth degree. His name is Honinbo
Shuyei, and he is the only player who has attained the ninth degree during the period
called the “Meiji,” or since the fall of the Shogunate forty years ago.
</p>
<p>This arrangement of the players in degrees is unknown in China and Korea. On the other
hand, it is in use in the Ryukyu or Loochoo Islands.
</p>
<p>The Japanese seem to have regarded the classification in degrees as an absolute standard
of measurement. Nevertheless, it must necessarily have varied from time to time, and
in the course of centuries the standard must gradually have risen.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p>Players of high rank who are challenged by the improving players of the lower grades
will instinctively desire to make it more difficult for the new players to attain
the higher degree, because their own fame, which is their highest possession, depends
upon the result of the game; and assuming that all trial games could be conducted
in an impartial and judicial spirit, nevertheless, all the players would become more
expert from the hard practice, even if their skill in relation to each other remained
the same.
</p>
<p>Thus a seventh degree player of to-day would be better in a year although he still
remained in the seventh degree, and this constant raising of the standard must lead
us to suppose that a player of the seventh degree now is quite equal or perhaps superior
to an eighth or ninth degree player of a hundred or two hundred years ago. As an illustration
of this increase in skill, we only have to compare the standard set in the Ryukyu
Islands. They also established the classification in degrees soon after the foundation
of the Academy in Japan, and then the two institutions seem to have lost touch. Korschelt
relates that for the first time about the year 1880 a Go player of the second degree
from the Satsuma province visited those Islands and tried his skill with their best
players, and found that he could easily defeat the players there classified as of
the fifth degree.
</p>
<p>The position as head of the Academy was much coveted by Go players, but it was generally
held by the Honinbo family. One of the last incidents in relation to the Academy tells
of an attempt on the part of Inouye Inseki, the eleventh of that line, to obtain the
headship of the Academy when Honinbo Jowa, who was the twelfth Honinbo, retired. Inseki
was afraid he could not obtain <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>the coveted position by a contest, and therefore strove to obtain it by intrigue from
the Shogun’s officer intrusted with the business of the Academy. When Jowa retired
he was not unaware of the desires of Inseki, but it did not trouble him much, as he
felt confident that the fourteenth Honinbo, whose name was Shuwa, could successfully
defend his title. However, at last matters came to such a point that Jowa ordered
Shuwa to present a petition to the Shogun requesting that the title be settled by
contest, but the Shogun’s officer, who was in league with Inseki, returned the petition,
whereupon all of the Honinbo house rose and insisted on their rights in accordance
with custom and precedent, and at last their petition was granted. It was fixed that
the title was to be decided by ten games, and the first game began at the residence
of the Shogun’s officer, Inaba Tango no Kami, on the 29th of November, in the eleventh
year of Tempo (about sixty-six years ago), and it ended the same year on the 13th
of December. There was an adjournment of four days, and on one occasion the contest
lasted all night. Therefore in all it took nine days and one night to finish the game.
</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to say that both players put forth all their efforts in this life
and death struggle, and it is said that Inseki’s excitement was so intense as to cause
blood to gush from his mouth, but he finally lost by four stones, and the other nine
games were not played. Inseki, however, mortified by his defeat, again challenged
Shuwa. This game began on the 16th of May in the thirteenth year of Tempo, and lasted
two days. Inseki again lost by six stones. On November 17th of the same year a third
contest took place between Shuwa and Inseki in the presence <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>of the Shogun in his palace at Tokio. Inseki again lost by four stones. In all these
contests Inseki as the challenger had the first move, and he finally became convinced
of his inability to win from the scion of the Honinbo family, and abandoned his life-long
desire, and it is related that thereupon the houses of Honinbo and Inouye became more
friendly than ever.
</p>
<p>In the first half of the nineteenth century Go had a period of great development.
This occurred according to the Japanese calendar in the periods called Bun Kwa (1804–1818),
Bun Sei (1818–1829), and Tempo (1830–1844). The collection of specimen games of that
time are to-day regarded as models, and the methods of play and of opening the game
then in use are still studied, although they have been somewhat superseded. The best
games were played by the Honinbos Dosaku and Jowa and Yasui Sanchi.
</p>
<p>On the fall of the Shogunate in the year 1868 the Go Academy came to an end, and with
it the regulation of the game by the State. A few years later the daimios were dispossessed,
and they did not feel an obligation as private individuals to retain the services
of the Go players who had been in attendance at their courts. Thereupon ensued a sad
time for the masters of the game, who had theretofore for the most part lived by the
practice of their art, and to make things still worse, the Japanese people lost their
interest in Go. Upon the opening of the country the people turned with enthusiasm
to the foreigners. Foreign things were more prized than native things, and among the
things of native origin the game of Go was neglected.
</p>
<p>About the year 1880, however, a reaction set in; interest in the old national game
was revived, and at the present <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>day it is fostered with as much zeal as in the olden times.
</p>
<p>Most of the higher officials of the government, and also the officers in the army
and navy, are skilled players. The great daily newspapers of the capitals have a Go
department, just as some of our periodicals have a department devoted to Chess, and
the game is very much played at the hot springs and health resorts, and clubs, and
teachers of the art are found in all of the larger cities. Go has always retained
something of its early aristocratic character, and in fact, it is still regarded as
necessary for a man of refinement to possess a certain skill at the game.
</p>
<p>During the recent Russo-Japanese War the strategy employed by the Japanese commanders
certainly suggested the methods of play used in the game of Go. Whether this was an
accidental resemblance or not I cannot say. At Liao Yang it seemed as if Marshal Oyama
had got three of the necessary stones advantageously placed, but the Russians escaped
before the fourth could be moved into position. At the final battle of Mukden the
enveloping strategy characteristic of the game was carried out with still greater
success.
</p>
<p>At the present time the division into the four schools of Honinbo, Inouye, Hayashi,
and Yasui, no longer exists, and Go players are divided into the schools of Honinbo
and Hoyensha. This latter school was established about the year 1880 by Murase Shuho,
to whom reference has already been made.
</p>
<p>The Honinbo school is the successor of the old Academy, while the new school has made
one or two innovations, one of the most fortunate being a rule that no game shall
last <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>longer than twenty-four hours without interruption. The Hoyensha school also recognized
the degree “Inaka Shodan,” which means the “first degree in the country,” and is allowed
to a class of players who are regarded as entitled to the first degree in their native
town, but who are generally undeceived when they meet the recognized “Shodan” players
of the metropolis.
</p>
<p>While in Japan Go has attained such a high development, largely through the help of
the government, as has been shown, it seems to be decadent in its motherland of China.
The Japanese players assure us that there is no player in China equal to a Japanese
player of the first degree. In Korea also the game is played, but the skill there
attained is also immensely below the Japanese standard.
</p>
<p>Having now given an idea of the importance of the game in the eyes of the Japanese,
and the length of time it has been played, we will proceed to a description of the
board and stones, and then take up the details of the play.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch2" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e263">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">II</h2>
<h2 class="main">DESCRIPTION OF THE BOARD AND STONES</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The board, or “Go Ban” as it is called in Japanese, is a solid block of wood, about
seventeen and a half inches long, sixteen inches broad, and generally about four or
five inches thick. It has four detachable feet or legs so that as it stands on the
floor it is about eight inches high. The board and feet are always stained yellow.
</p>
<p>The best boards in Japan are made of a wood called “Kaya” (<i lang="la">Torreya Nucifera</i>) a species of yew. They are also made of a wood called “Icho” or Gingko (<i lang="la">Salisburia adiantifolia</i>) and of “Hinoki” (<i lang="la">Thuya Obtusa</i>) a kind of cedar. At all events they must be of hard wood, and yet not so hard as
to be unpleasant to the touch when the stone is placed on the board, and the wood
must further have the quality of resonance, because the Japanese enjoy hearing the
sound made by the stone as it is played, and they always place it on the board with
considerable force when space will permit. The Japanese expression for playing Go,
to wit, “<span lang="ja-latn">Go wo utsu</span>,” literally means to “strike” Go, referring to the impact of the stone. In Korea
this feature is carried to such an extreme that wires are stretched beneath the board,
so that as a stone is played a distinct musical sound is produced. The best boards
should, of course, be free from knots, and the grain should run diagonally across
them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the back of the board there is cut a square depression. The purpose of this is
probably to make the block more resonant, although the old Japanese stories say that
this depression was put there originally to receive the blood of the vanquished in
case the excitement of the game led to a sanguinary conflict.
</p>
<p>The legs of the board are said to be shaped to resemble the fruit of the plant called
“Kuchinashi” or Cape Jessamine (<i lang="la">Gardenia floribunda</i>), the name of which plant by accident also means “without a mouth,” and this is supposed
to suggest to onlookers that they refrain from making comments on the game (a suggestion
which all Chess players will appreciate).
</p>
<p>On the board, parallel with each edge, are nineteen thin, lacquered black lines. These
lines are about four one-hundredths of an inch wide. It has been seen from the dimensions
given that the board is not exactly square, and the field therefore is a “parallelogram,
the sides of which are sixteen and a half and fifteen inches long respectively, and
the lines in one direction are a little bit farther apart than in the other. These
lines, by their crossing, produce three hundred and sixty-one points of intersection,
including the corners and the points along the edge of the field.
</p>
<p>The stones are placed on these points of intersection, and not in the spaces as the
pieces are in Chess or Checkers. These intersections are called “Me” or “Moku” in
Japanese, which really means “an eye.” Inasmuch as the word as used in this connection
is untranslatable, I shall hereafter refer to these points of intersection by their
Japanese name.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the board, as shown in the diagram (<a href="#plate01">Plate 1</a>), are nine little circles. It is on these circles that the handicap stones when given
are placed. They have no other function in the game, but they are supposed also to
have some sort of symbolical meaning. Chamberlain states that these spots or “Seimoku”
are supposed to represent the chief celestial bodies, and that the central one is
called “Taikyoku”; that is, the primordial principle of the universe. In the work
of Stewart Culin referred to in the preface it is stated that they correspond to the
nine lights of heaven—the sun, moon and the seven stars of the constellation “Tau”
(Ursa Major). Indeed the whole arrangement of the board is said to have some symbolical
significance, the number of crosses (exclusive of the central one) representing the
three hundred and sixty degrees of latitude, and the number of white and black stones
corresponding to the number of days of the year; but nowadays the Japanese do not
make much of a point of the astronomical significance of the board or of the “Seimoku.”
</p>
<p>The stones or “Ishi” with which the game is played are three hundred and sixty-one
in number, corresponding to the number of “Me” or points of intersection on the board.
One hundred and eighty of these stones are white and the remaining one hundred and
eighty-one are black. As the weaker player has the black stones and the first move,
obviously the extra stone must be black. In practice the entire number of stones is
never used, as at the end of the game there are always vacant spaces on the board.
The Japanese generally keep these stones in gracefully shaped, lacquered boxes or
“Go tsubo.”

<span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>The white stones are made of a kind of white shell; they are highly polished, and
are exceedingly pleasant to the touch. The best come from the provinces of Hitachi
and Mikawa. The black are made of stone, generally a kind of slate that comes from
the Nachi cataract in Kishiu. As they are used they become almost jet-black, and they
are also pleasant to the touch, but not so much so as the white. A good set is quite
dear, and cannot be purchased under several yen. The ideograph formerly used for “Go
ishi” indicates that originally they were made of wood, and not of stone, and the
old Chinese ideograph shows that in that country they were wooden pieces painted black
and white. The use of polished shell for the white stones was first introduced in
the Ashikaga period.
</p>
<p>In form the stones are disk-shaped, but not always exactly round, and are convex on
both surfaces, so that they tremble slightly when placed on the board. They are about
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and about one-eighth of an inch in thickness.
The white stones are generally a trifle larger than the black ones; for some strange
reason those of both colors are a little bit wider than they should be in order to
fit the board. Korschelt carefully measured the stones which he used, and found that
the black were seventeen-sixteenths of the distance between the vertical lines on
his board, and about eighteen-nineteenths of the distance between the horizontal lines,
while the white stones were thirteen-twelfths of the distance between the vertical
lines and thirty-six thirty-sevenths of the distance between the horizontal lines.
I found about the same relation of size in the board and stones which I use.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure p022width" id="p022"><img src="images/p022.jpg" alt="Playing Go" width="720" height="449"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Playing Go</span></p>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>The result of this is that the stones do not have quite room enough and lap over each
other, and when the board is very full, they push each other out of place. To make
matters still worse the Japanese are not very careful to put the stones exactly on
the points of intersection, but place them carelessly, so that the board has an irregular
appearance. It is probable that the unsymmetrical shape of the board and the irregularity
of the size of the stones arise from the antipathy that the Japanese have to exact
symmetry. At any rate, it is all calculated to break up the monotonous appearance
which the board would have if the spaces were exactly square, and the stones were
exactly round and fitted properly in their places.
</p>
<p>In Japan the board is placed on the floor, and the players sit on the floor also,
facing each other, as shown in the illustration, and generally the narrower side of
the board is placed so as to face the players. Since the introduction of tables in
Japan Go boards are also made thinner and without feet, but the game seems to lose
some of its charm when the customs of the old Japan are departed from.
</p>
<p>The Japanese always take the stone between the middle and index fingers, and not between
the thumb and index finger as we are likely to do, and they place it on the board
smartly and with great skill, so that it gives a cheerful sound, as before stated.
</p>
<p>For use in this country the board need not be so thick, and need not, of course, have
feet, but if it is attempted to play the game on cardboard, which has a dead sound
as the stones are played, it is surprising how much the pleasure of the game is diminished.
The author has found <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>that Casino chips are the best substitute for the Japanese stones.
</p>
<p>Originally the board used for the game of Go was not so large, and the intersecting
lines in each direction were only seventeen in number. At the time of the foundation
of the Go Academy this was the size of board in use. As the game developed the present
number of lines became fixed after trial and comparison with other possible sizes.
Korschelt made certain experiments with the next possible larger size in which the
number of lines in each direction was twenty-one, and it seemed that the game could
still be played, although it made necessary the intellect of a past master to grasp
the resulting combinations. If more than twenty-one lines are used Korschelt states
that the combinations are beyond the reach of the human mind.
</p>
<p>In closing the description of the board it may be interesting to point out that the
game which we call “Go Bang” or “Five in a Row,” is played on what is really a Japanese
Go board, and the word “Go Bang” is merely another phonetic imitation of the words
by which the Japanese designate their board. I have found, however, that the “Go Bang”
boards sold in the stores in this country are an imitation of the original Japanese
“Go ban,” and have only seventeen lines, and are therefore a little too small for
the game as now played. The game which we call “Go Bang” also originated in Japan,
and is well known and still played there. They call it “Go Moku Narabe,” which means
to arrange five “Me,” the word “Go” in this case meaning “five,” and “Moku” being
the alternative way of pronouncing the ideograph for eye. “Go Moku Narabe” is often
played by good Go players, generally <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>for relaxation, as it is a vastly simpler game than Go, and can be finished much more
rapidly. It is not, however, to be despised, as when played by good players there
is considerable chance for analysis, and the play often covers the entire board.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The players play alternately, and the weaker player has the black stones and plays
first, unless a handicap has been given, in which case the player using the white
stones has the first move. (In the olden times this was just reversed.) They place
the stones on the vacant points of intersection on the board, or “Me,” and they may
place them wherever they please, with the single exception of the case called “Ko,”
which will be hereafter explained. When the stones are once played they are never
moved again.
</p>
<p>The object of the game of Go is to secure territory. Just as the object of the game
of Chess is not to capture pieces, but to checkmate the adverse King, so in Go the
ultimate object is not to capture the adversary’s stones, but to so arrange matters
that at the end of the game a player’s stones will surround as much vacant space as
possible. At the end of the game, however, before the amount of vacant space is calculated,
the stones that have been taken are used to fill up the vacant spaces claimed by the
adversary; that is to say, the captured black stones are used to fill up the spaces
surrounded by the player having the white pieces, and vice versa, and the player who
has the greatest amount of territory after the captured stones are used in this way,
is the winner of the game. However, if the players, fearing <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>each other, merely fence in parts of the board without regard to each other’s play,
a most uninteresting game results, and the Japanese call this by the contemptuous
epithet “Ji dori go,” or “ground taking Go.” I have noticed that beginners in this
country sometimes start to play in this way, and it is one of the many ways by which
the play of a mere novice may be recognized. The best games arise when the players
in their efforts to secure territory attack each other’s stones or groups of stones,
and we therefore must know how a stone can be taken.
</p>
<p>A stone is taken when it is surrounded on four opposite sides as shown in <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">I</span>. When it is taken it is removed from the board. It is not necessary that a stone
should also be surrounded diagonally, which would make eight stones necessary in order
to take one; neither do four stones placed on the adjacent diagonal intersections
cause a stone to be taken: they do not directly attack the stone in the center at
all. <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IV</span>, shows this situation.
</p>
<p>A stone which is placed on the edge of the board may be surrounded and captured by
three stones, as shown in <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, and if a stone is placed in the extreme corner of the board, it may be surrounded
and taken by two stones, as shown in <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>.
</p>
<p>In actual practice it seldom or never happens that a stone or group of stones is surrounded
by the minimum number requisite under the rule, for in that case the player whose
stones were threatened could generally manage to break through his adversary’s line.
It is almost always necessary to add helping stones to those that are strictly necessary
in completing the capture. <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">V</span>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>shows four stones which are surrounded with the minimum number of stones. <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VI</span>, shows the same group with a couple of helping stones added, which would probably
be found necessary in actual play.
</p>
<p>It follows from this rule that stones which are on the same line parallel with the
edges of the board are connected, and support each other, <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VII</span>, while stones which are on the same <i>diagonal</i> line are not connected, and do not support each other, <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VIII</span>. In order to surround stones which are on the same line, and therefore connected,
it is necessary to surround them all in order to take them, while stones which are
arranged on a diagonal line, and therefore unconnected, may be taken one at a time.
On <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>, if there were a stone placed at S 18, it would not be connected with the stone in
the corner, and would not help it in any way. On the other hand, as has been said,
it is not necessary to place a white stone on that point in order to complete the
capture of the stone in the corner.
</p>
<p>In order to capture a group or chain of stones containing vacant space, it must be
completely surrounded inside and out; for instance, the black group shown on <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IX</span>, while it has no hope of life if it is White’s play is nevertheless not completely
surrounded. In order to surround it, it is necessary to play on the three vacant intersections
at M 11, N 11, and O 11. The same group of stones is shown in Diagram <span class="asc">X</span> completely surrounded. (It may be said in passing that White must play at N 11 first
or the black stones can defend themselves; we shall understand this better in a moment.)
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate02width" id="plate02"><img src="images/plate02.png" alt="Plate 2" width="593" height="586"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 2</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>In practice it often happens that a stone or group of <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>stones is regarded as dead before it is completely surrounded, because when the situation
is observed to be hopeless the losing player abandons it, and addresses his energies
to some other part of the board. It is advantageous for the losing player to abandon
such a group as soon as possible, for, if he continues to add to the group, he loses
not only the territory but the added stones also. If the circumstances are such that
his opponent has to reply to his moves in the hopeless territory, the loss is not
so great, as the opponent is meanwhile filling up spaces which would otherwise be
vacant, and against an inferior player there is a chance of the adversary making a
slip and allowing the threatened stones to save themselves. If, however, the situation
is so clearly hopeless that the adversary is not replying move for move, then every
stone added to such a group means a loss of two points.
</p>
<p>At the end of the game such abandoned groups of stones are removed from the board
just as if they had been completely surrounded and killed, and it is not necessary
for the player having the advantage actually to surround and kill such a group. It
is enough if they obviously can be killed. The theory on which this rule proceeds
is that if the players play alternately, no advantage would be gained by either side
in the process of actually surrounding such a group, and its completion would only
be a waste of time. But let us suppose that a black group at the end of the game is
found to be hopeless and also completely surrounded with the exception of one point.
The question arises, can the Black player demand that his adversary play on the vacant
space in order to kill this group, for, if he could, it is obvious he would gain one
“Me” by so doing. The answer <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>is, he cannot so demand, and his adversary is not bound to play on this point, and
the hopeless or abandoned stones are removed without further play. We might call such
groups “dead.” They may be distinguished from stones that are “taken,” because these
latter are removed at once, whereas “dead” stones are removed only at the end of the
game.
</p>
<p>As a corollary to the rule for surrounding and taking stones, it follows that a group
of stones containing two disconnected vacant intersections or “Me” cannot be taken.
This is not a separate rule. It follows necessarily from the method by which stones
are taken. Nevertheless in practice it is the <i>most important principle in the game</i>.
</p>
<p>In order to understand the rule or principle of the two “Me,” we must first look at
the situation shown in <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">I</span>. There, if a black stone is played at F 15, although it is played on an intersection
entirely surrounded by white stones, it nevertheless lives because the moment it is
played it has the effect of killing the entire white group; that is to say, a stone
may be played on an intersection where it is completely surrounded if as it is played
it has the effect of completely surrounding the adversary’s stones already on the
board. If, on the other hand, we have a situation as shown in <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, a black stone may indeed be played on one of the vacant intersections, but when
it is so played the white group is not completely surrounded, because there still
remains one space yet to be filled, and the black stone itself is dead as soon as
it touches the board, and hence it would be impossible to surround this group of white
stones unless two stones were played at once. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>white stones, therefore, can never be surrounded, and form an impregnable position.
</p>
<p>This is the principle of the two “Me,” and when a player’s group of stones is hard
pressed, and his adversary is trying to surround them, if he can so place the stones
that two disconnected complete “Me” are left, they are safe forever. It makes no difference
whether the vacant “Me” are on the edges or in the corners of the board, or how far
from each other they may be.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VI</span>, shows a group of stones containing two vacant “Me” on the edge of the board. This
group is perfectly safe against attack. A beginner might ask why the white group shown
on <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">V</span>, is not safe. The difficulty with that group is, that when Black has played at S
9, there are no “Me” in it at all as the word is used in this connection, not even
a “Kageme” as shown in <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>, because a “Me,” in order to be available for the purpose of defense, must be a vacant
intersection that is surrounded on four sides, just as a captured stone must be surrounded,
and therefore on the sides of the board it can be made by three stones, and in the
corner of the board by two stones, but it is absolutely necessary, in addition to
the minimum number of surrounding stones, to have helping stones to guard the surrounding
stones against attack. This brings us to what the Japanese call “Kageme.”
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate03width" id="plate03"><img src="images/plate03.png" alt="Plate 3" width="600" height="592"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 3</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>In actual play there are many groups of stones that at first glance seem to have two
vacant “Me” in them, but which on analysis, will be found vulnerable to attack. A
“Me” that looks somewhat as if it were complete, but is, nevertheless, destructible
is called “Kageme.” “Kage” <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>means “chipped” or “incomplete.” <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>, is an illustration of this. A beginner might think that the white group was safe,
but Black can kill the upper six white stones by playing at E 3, and then on the next
move can kill the remainder by playing at G 2. Therefore, E 3 is not a perfect “Me,”
but is “Kageme.” G 2 is a perfect “Me,” but one is not enough to save the group. In
this group if the stone at F 4 or D 2 were white, there would be two perfect “Me,”
and the group would be safe. In a close game beginners often find it difficult to
distinguish between a perfect “Me” and “Kageme.”
</p>
<p>Groups of stones which contain vacant spaces, can be lost or saved according as two
disconnected “Me” can or cannot be formed in those spaces, and the most interesting
play in the game occurs along the sides and especially in the corners of the board
in attempting to form or attempting to prevent the formation of these “Me.” The attacking
player often plays into the vacant space and sacrifices several stones with the ultimate
object of reducing the space to one “Me”; and, on the other hand, the defending player
by selecting a fortunate intersection may make it impossible for the stones to be
killed. There is opportunity for marvelous ingenuity in the attack and defense of
these positions. A simple example of defense is shown in <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IV</span>, where, if it is White’s turn, and he plays in the corner of the board at T 19, he
can save his stones. If, on the other hand, he plays anywhere else, the two “Me” can
never be formed. The beginner would do well to work out this situation for himself.
</p>
<p>The series of diagrams commencing at <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">V</span>, show the theoretical method of reducing vacant spaces <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>by the sacrifice of stones. This series is taken from Korschelt, and the position
as it arose in actual play is shown on <a href="#plate10">Plate 10</a>, depicting a complete game. In <a href="#plate03">Plate 3</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">V</span>, the white group is shown externally surrounded, and the black stone has just been
played at S 9, rendering the group hopeless. The same group is shown on the opposite
side of the board at <a href="#plate04">Plate 4</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">I</span>, but Black has added three more stones and could kill the white group on the next
move. Therefore, White plays at A 12, and the situation shown in <a href="#plate04">Plate 4</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, arises, where the same group is shown on the lower edge of the board. Now, if it
were White’s move, he could save his group by playing at J 2, and the situation which
would then arise is shown on <a href="#plate04">Plate 4</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>, where White has three perfect “Me,” one more than enough. However, it is not White’s
move, and Black plays on the coveted intersection, and then adds two more stones until
the situation shown in <a href="#plate04">Plate 4</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IV</span>, arises. Then White must again play at S 8 in order to save his stones from immediate
capture, and the situation shown at <a href="#plate05">Plate 5</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">I</span>, comes about. Black again plays at J 18, adds one more stone, and we have the situation
shown in <a href="#plate05">Plate 5</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, where it is obvious that White must play at C 11 in order to save his group from
immediate capture, thus leaving only two vacant spaces. It is unnecessary to continue
the analysis further, but at the risk of explaining what is apparent, it might be
pointed out that Black would play on one of these vacant spaces, and if White killed
the stone (which it would not pay White to do) Black would play again on the space
thus made vacant, and completely surround and kill the entire white group.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span></p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate04width" id="plate04"><img src="images/plate04.png" alt="Plate 4" width="598" height="588"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 4</span></p>

</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>A group with five vacant “Me,” as shown in the preceding diagrams, is a situation
well known to the Japanese, so much so that they have a special phrase or saying that
applies to it, to wit, “<span lang="ja-latn">Go moku naka de wa ju san te</span>,” which means that it takes thirteen turns to reduce a group having five such “Me”
in the center.
</p>
<p>As we have previously seen, in actual play this white group would be regarded as “dead”
as distinguished from “taken,” and this series of moves would not be played out. White
obviously would not play in the space, and he could not demand that Black play therein
in order to complete the actual surrounding of the stones, and the only purpose of
giving this series of diagrams is to show theoretically how the white stones can be
killed. However, the killing of these stones would be necessary if the surrounding
black line were in turn attacked (“Semeai”), in which case it might be a race to see
whether the internal white stones could be completely surrounded and killed before
the external white group could get in complete contact with the black line.
</p>
<p>Stones which are sacrificed in order to kill a larger group are called “Sute ishi”
by the Japanese, from “Suteru,” meaning “to cast or throw away,” and “Ishi,” a “stone.”
</p>
<p>It may be noted that if a group contains four connected vacant intersections in a
line it is safe, because if the adversary attempts to reduce it, two disconnected
“Me” can be formed in the space by simply playing a stone adjacent to the adversary’s
stone, as shown in <a href="#plate05">Plate 5</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>, where, if Black plays for instance at K 11, White replies at L 11, and secures the
two “Me.” Even if these four connected vacant intersections are not in a straight
line, they <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>are nevertheless sufficient for the purpose, provided the fourth “Me” is connected
at the end of the three, and the Japanese express this by their saying “Magari shimoku
wa me,” or four “Me” turning a corner. Neither does it make any difference whether
the four connected “Me” are in the center of the board or along the edge. On <a href="#plate05">Plate 5</a>, Diagrams <span class="asc">IV</span> and <span class="asc">V</span>, are examples of “Magari shimoku wa me,” and they both are safe. It is interesting,
however, to compare these situations with that shown at <a href="#plate04">Plate 4</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, where the fourth intersection is not connected at the end of the line, and which
group Black can kill if it is his move, as we already have seen.
</p>
<p>If, however, such a group contains only three connected vacant intersections, and
it is the adversary’s move, it can be killed, because the adversary by playing on
the middle intersection can prevent the formation of two disconnected “Me.” We saw
a group of this kind on <a href="#plate02">Plate 2</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IX</span>, which can be killed by playing at N 11. Obviously, if it is Black’s move in this
case, the group can be saved by playing at N 11; obviously, also, if White, being
a mere novice, plays elsewhere than at N 11, Black saves the stones by playing there
and killing the white stone. <a href="#plate05">Plate 5</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VI</span>, shows another group containing only three vacant intersections. These can be killed
if it is Black’s move by playing at A 1. On the other hand, if it is White’s move,
he can save them by playing on the same point.
</p>
<p>Of course, if a group of stones contains a large number of vacant intersections, it
is perfectly safe unless the vacant space is so large that the adversary can have
a chance of forming an entire new living group of stones therein.
</p>
<p>We now come to the one exception to the rule that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>players may place their stones at will on any vacant intersection on the board. This
rule is called the rule of “Ko,” and is shown on <a href="#plate06">Plate 6</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">I</span>. Assuming that it is White’s turn to play, he can play at D 17 and take the black
stone at C 17 which is already surrounded on three sides, and the position shown in
<a href="#plate06">Plate 6</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">II</span>, would then arise. It is now White’s turn to play, and if he plays at C 13, the white
stone which has just been put down will be likewise surrounded and could be at once
taken from the board. Black, however, is not permitted to do this immediately, but
must first play somewhere else, and this gives White the choice of filling up this
space (C 13) and defending his stone, or of following his adversary to some other
portion of the board. The reason for this rule in regard to “Ko” is very clear. If
the players were permitted to take and retake the stones as shown in the diagram,
the series of moves would be endless, and the game could never be finished. It is
something like perpetual check in Chess, but the Japanese, in place of calling the
game a draw, compel the second player to move elsewhere and thus allow the game to
continue. In an actual game when a player is prevented from retaking a stone by the
rule of “Ko,” he always tries to play in some other portion of the board where he
threatens a larger group of stones than is involved in the situation where “Ko” occurs,
and thus often he can compel his adversary to follow him to this other part of the
field, and then return to retake in “Ko.” His adversary then will play in some part
of the field, if possible, where another group can be threatened, and so on. Sometimes
in a hotly contested game the battle will rage around a place where “Ko” occurs and
the space will be taken and retaken several times.

<div class="figure plate06width" id="plate06"><img src="images/plate06.png" alt="Plate 6" width="596" height="589"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 6</span></p>

<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>Korschelt states that the ideograph for “Ko” means “talent” or “skilfulness,” in which
he is very likely wrong, as it is more accurately translated by our word “threat”;
but be this as it may, it is certainly true that the rule in regard to “Ko” gives
opportunity for a great display of skill, and as the better players take advantage
of this rule with much greater ingenuity, it is a good idea for the weaker player
as far as possible to avoid situations where its application arises.
</p>
<p>There is a situation which sometimes arises and which might be mistaken for “Ko.”
It is where a player takes more than one stone and the attacking stone is threatened
on three sides, or where only one stone is taken, but the adversary in replying can
take not only the last stone played, but others also. In these cases the opponent
can retake immediately, because it will at once be seen that an endless exchange of
moves (which makes necessary the rule of “Ko”) would not occur. A situation of this
kind is shown on <a href="#plate06">Plate 6</a>, Diagrams <span class="asc">III</span>, <span class="asc">IV</span>, and <span class="asc">V</span>, where White by playing at C 8 (Diagram <span class="asc">III</span>) takes the three black stones, producing the situation shown in Diagram <span class="asc">IV</span>, and Black is permitted immediately to retake the white stone, producing the state
of affairs shown in Diagram <span class="asc">V</span>. The Japanese call such a situation “Ute kaeshi,” which means “returning a blow.”
It forms no exception to the ordinary rules of the game, and only needs to be pointed
out because a beginner might think that the rule of “Ko” applied to it.
</p>
<p>We will now take up the situation called “Seki.” “Seki” means a “barrier” or “impasse”—it
is a different word from the “Seki” in the phrase “Jo seki.” “Seki” also is somewhat
<span class="corr" id="xd31e956" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> to perpetual check. It arises when a <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>vacant space is surrounded partly by white and partly by black stones in such a way
that, if either player places a stone therein, his adversary can thereupon capture
the entire group. Under these circumstances, of course, neither player desires to
place a stone on that portion of the board, and the rules of the game do not compel
him to do so. That portion of the board is regarded as neutral territory, and at the
end of the game the vacant “Me” are not counted in favor of either player. <a href="#plate06">Plate 6</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VI</span>, gives an illustration of “Seki,” where it will be seen that if Black plays at either
S 16 or T 16 White can kill the black stones in the corner by playing on the other
point, and if White plays on either point Black can kill the white stones by filling
the remaining vacancy. Directly below, on Diagram <span class="asc">VII</span>, is shown the same group, but the corner black stone has been taken out. The position
is now no longer “Seki,” but is called by the Japanese “<span lang="ja-latn">Me ari me nashi</span>,” or literally “having ‘Me,’ not having ‘Me.’ ” Here the white stones are dead, because
if Black plays, for instance, at T 4 White cannot kill the black stones by playing
at S 4, for the reason that the vacant “Me” at T 1 still remains. The beginner might
confuse “Seki” with “<span lang="ja-latn">Me ari me nashi</span>,” and while a good player has no trouble in recognizing the difference when the situation
arises, it takes considerable foresight sometimes so to play as to produce one situation
or the other.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate06">Plate 6</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VIII</span>, shows another group which might be mistaken for “Seki,” but here, if White plays
at J 19, the black stones can be killed, further proceedings being somewhat similar
to those we saw in the illustration of “Go moku naka de wa ju san te.” <a href="#plate07">Plate 7</a> shows a large <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>group of stones from which inevitably “Seki” will result. It would be well for the
student to work this out for himself. “Seki” very seldom or never occurs in games
between good players, and it rarely occurs in any game.
</p>
<p>It is a rule of the game to give warning when a stone or group of stones is about
to be completely surrounded. For this purpose the Japanese use the word “Atari” (from
“<span lang="ja-latn">ataru</span>,” to touch lightly), which corresponds quite closely to the expression “<span lang="fr">gardez</span>” in Chess. If this warning were omitted, the player whose stones were about to be
taken should have the right to take his last move over and save the imperiled position
if he could. This rule is not so strictly observed as formerly; it belongs more to
the etiquette of the old Japan.
</p>
<p>The game comes to an end when the frontiers of the opposing groups are in contact.
This does not mean that the board is entirely covered, for the obvious reason that
the space inside the groups or chains of stones is purposely left vacant, for that
is the only part of the board which counts; but so long as there is any vacant space
lying <i>between</i> the opposing groups that must be disposed of in some way, and when it is so disposed
of it will be found that the white and black groups are in complete contact.
</p>
<p>Just at the end of the game there will be found isolated vacant intersections or “Me”
on the frontier lines, and it does not make any difference which player fills these
up. They are called by the Japanese “Dame,” which means “useless.” (The word “Dame”
is likely to be confusing when it is first heard, because the beginner jumps to the
conclusion that it is some new kind of a “Me.” This arises from a coincidence only.
Anything that is useless or profitless <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>is called “Dame” in Japanese, but etymologically the word really means “horse’s eye,”
as the Japanese, not being admirers of the vacant stare of that noble animal, have
used this word as a synonym for all that is useless. Therefore the syllable “Me” does
mean an eye, and is the same word that is used to designate the intersections, but
its recurrence in this connection is merely an accident.)
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate07width" id="plate07"><img src="images/plate07.png" alt="Plate 7" width="595" height="590"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 7</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>It is difficult for the beginner at first to understand why the filling of these “Dame”
results in no advantage to either player, and beginners often fill up such spaces
even before the end of the game, feeling that they are gaining ground slowly but surely;
and the Japanese have a saying, “<span lang="ja-latn">Heta go ni dame nashi</span>,” which means that there are no “Dame” in beginners’ Go, as beginners do not recognize
their uselessness. On the other hand, a necessary move will sometimes look like “Dame.”
The moves that are likely to be so confused are the final connecting moves or “Tsugu,”
where a potential connection has been made early in the game, but which need to be
filled up to complete the chain. In the Illustrative Game, Number I, the “Dame” are
all given, but a little practice is necessary before they can always be recognized.
</p>
<p>When the “Dame” have been filled, and the dead stones have been removed from the board,
there is no reason why the players should not at once proceed to counting up which
of them has the greatest amount of vacant space, less, of course, the number of stones
they have lost, and thus determine who is the victor. As a matter of practice, however,
the Japanese do not do this immediately, but, purely for the purpose of facilitating
the count, the player having the white pieces would fill up his adversary’s territory
with <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>the black stones he had captured as far as they would go, and the player having the
black stones would fill up his adversary’s territory with the white stones that he
had captured; and thereupon the entire board is reconstructed, so that the vacant
spaces come into rows of fives and tens, so that they are easier to count. This has
really nothing to do with the game, and it is merely a device to make the counting
of the spaces easier, but it seems like a mysterious process to a novice, and adds
not a little to the general mystery with which the end of the game seems to be surrounded
when an Occidental sees it played for the first time. This process of arrangement
is called “Me wo tsukuru.” It may be added that if any part of the board contains
the situation called “Seki,” that portion is left alone, and is not reconstructed
like the rest of the board.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate08">Plate 8</a> shows a completed game in which the “Dame” have all been filled, but the dead stones
have not yet been removed from the board. Let us first see which of the stones are
dead. It is easy to see that the white stone at N 11 is hopeless, as it is cut off
in every direction. The same is true of the white stone at B 18. It is not so easy
to see that the black stones at L and M 18, N, O, P, Q and R 17, N 16, and M and N
15 are dead, but against a good player they would have no hope of forming the necessary
two “Me,” and they are therefore conceded to be dead; but a good player could probably
manage to defend them against a novice. It is still more difficult to see why the
irregular white group of eighteen stones on the left-hand side of the board has been
abandoned, but there also White has no chance of making the necessary two “Me.” At
the risk of repetition I will again point out that these groups of <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>dead stones can be taken from the board without further play.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate09">Plate 9</a> shows the same game after the dead stones have been removed and used to fill up the
respective territories, and after the board has been reconstructed in accordance with
the Japanese method, and it will be seen that in this case Black has won by one stone.
This result can be arrived at equally well by counting up the spaces on <a href="#plate08">Plate 8</a>, but they are easier to count on <a href="#plate09">Plate 9</a>, after the “<span lang="ja-latn">Me wo tsukuru</span>” has been done.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate10">Plate 10</a> shows another completed game. This plate is from Korschelt, and is interesting because
it contains an instructive error. The game is supposed to be completed, and the black
stone at C 18 is said to be dead. This is not true, because Black by playing at C
17 could not only save his stone, but kill the four white stones at the left-hand
side. Therefore, before this game is completed, White must play at C 17 to defend
himself. This is called “Tsugu.” On the left-hand side of the board is shown a white
group which is dead, and the method of reduction of which we have already studied
in detail. On the right side of the board are a few scattering black stones which
are dead, because they have no chance of forming a group with the necessary two “Me.”
The question may be asked whether it is necessary for White to play at C 1 or E 1
in order to complete the connection of the group in the corner, but he is not obliged
so to do unless Black chooses to play at B 1 or F 1, which, of course, Black would
not do.
</p>
<p>On <a href="#plate11">Plate 11</a>, this game also is shown as reconstructed for counting, and it will be seen that
White has won by two stones. Really this is an error of one stone, as White <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>should have played at C 17, as we have previously pointed out.
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>Sometimes at the end of the game players of moderate skill may differ as to whether
there is anything left to be done, and when one thinks there is no longer any advantage
to be gained by either side, he says, “<span lang="ja-latn">Mo arimasen, aru naraba o yuki nasai</span>,” that is to say, “I think there is nothing more to be done; if you think you can
gain anything, you may play,” and sometimes he will allow his adversary to play two
or three times in succession, reserving the right to step in if he thinks there is
a chance of his adversary reviving a group that is apparently dead.
</p>
<p>No part of the rules of the game has been more difficult for me to understand than
the methods employed at the end, and especially the rule in regard to the removal
of dead stones without actually surrounding them, but I trust in the foregoing examples
I have made this rule sufficiently clear. Moreover, it is not always easy to tell
whether stones are dead or alive. There is a little poem or “Hokku” in Japanese, which
runs as follows:
</p>
<div lang="ja-latn" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">“Iki shini wo
</p>
<p class="line">Shiranu nonki no
</p>
<p class="line">Go uchi kana,”</p>
</div>
<p class="first">which might be translated as “Oh! what kind of a Go player is he who does not know
whether his stones are alive or dead!” But while the Japanese author of this “Hokku”
may have regarded it as a simple thing, the Occidental student of the game would not
be likely to share his views. An instance of this is shown by the possibilities of
the supposedly dead black stone on <a href="#plate10">Plate 10</a>, and I think it would be fairer to state that the skill of a good Go player is most
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span>clearly shown by his ability to recognize immediately whether a group is dead or can
be saved; the study of our chapter on Problems will give further illustrations of
the difficulty and nicety of such decisions.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate11width" id="plate11"><img src="images/plate11.png" alt="Plate 11" width="593" height="590"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 11</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>We now come to the question of handicaps. Handicaps are given by the stronger player
allowing the weaker player to place a certain number of stones on the board before
the game begins, and we have seen in the chapter on the Description of the Board that
these stones are placed on the nine dotted intersections. If one stone is given, it
is usual to place it in the upper right-hand corner. If a second stone is given, it
is placed in the lower left-hand corner. If a third stone is given, it is placed in
the lower right-hand corner. The fourth is placed in the upper left-hand corner. The
fifth is placed at the center or “Ten gen.” When six are given, the center one is
removed, and the fifth and sixth are placed at the left and right-hand edges of the
board on line 10. If seven are given, these stones remain, and the seventh stone is
placed in the center. If eight are given, the center stone is again removed, and the
seventh and eighth stones are placed on the “Seimoku” on line K. If the ninth is given,
it is again placed in the center of the board.
</p>
<p>Between players of reasonable skill more than nine stones are never given, but when
the disparity between the players is too great, four other stones are sometimes given.
They are placed just outside the corner “Seimoku,” as shown on the diagram (<a href="#plate12">Plate 12</a>), and these extra stones are called “Furin” handicaps. “Furin” means “a small bell,”
as these stones suggest to the Japanese the bells which hang from the eaves at the
corners of a Japanese temple. When the disparity between the players is very great
indeed, sometimes <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>four more stones are given, and when given they are placed on the diagonal halfway
between the corner “Seimoku” and the center. These four stones are called “Naka yotsu,”
or “the four middle stones,” but such a handicap could only be given to the merest
novice.
</p>
<p></p>
<div class="figure plate12width" id="plate12"><img src="images/plate12.png" alt="Plate 12" width="594" height="589"><p class="figureHead"><span class="sc">Plate 12</span></p>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>We have now completed a survey of all the actual rules of the game, and it may be
well to summarize them in order that their real simplicity may be clearly seen; briefly,
they are as follows:
</p>
<p>1. The object of the game is to obtain vacant territory.
</p>
<p>2. The stones are placed on the intersections and on any vacant intersection the player
chooses (except in the case of “Ko”). After they are played they are not moved again.
</p>
<p>3. (<i>a</i>) One or more stones which are compactly surrounded by the stones of the other side
are said to be taken and are at once removed from the board.
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) Stones which, while not actually surrounded can inevitably be surrounded, are dead,
and can be taken from the board at the end of the game without further play.
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Taken or dead stones are used to fill up the adversary’s territory.
</p>
<p>4. The game is at an end when the opposing groups of stones are in absolute contact
(the case of “Seki” being the single exception).
</p>
<p>It is not possible to imagine a game with simpler rules, or the elements of which
are easier to acquire.
</p>
<p>We will now turn our attention to a few considerations as to the best methods of play,
and of certain moves and formations which occur in every game, and also to the names
which in Japanese are used to designate these things.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="ch4" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pageNum">[<a href="#xd31e281">Contents</a>]</span><div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">IV</h2>
<h2 class="main">GENERAL METHODS OF PLAY AND TERMINOLOGY OF THE GAME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As will be shown more in detail in the chapter on Openings or “Joseki,” the game is
commenced by playing in the corners of the board, and generally on one of the squares
adjacent to the handicap point. The reason for this is that the corners of the board
are natural fortresses, and can be more readily defended against attack. It is also
easier to form territory in the corners of the board. Next to the corners of the board
the sides of the board are easiest to defend, and territory is more easily formed
along the sides than in the center, and in an ordinary game the play generally proceeds
from the corners and edges to the center. The importance which the Japanese attach
to the corners is shown by their saying “<span lang="ja-latn">Yo sumi torarete go wo utsu na</span>,” or, “if the four corners are taken, cease playing.” Against a good player it is
next to impossible to form territory in the center of the board, unless it is based
on one of the sides or corners.
</p>
<p>There is, however, an old rule of etiquette which is not consistent with this theory
of the opening; it used to be regarded as exceedingly impolite and insulting to play
the first stone on the handicap point in the center of the board, called “Ten gen.”
It has been explained to me that the reason for this rule is that such a move was
supposed to <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>assure the victory to the first player, and it is related that when on one occasion
Murase Shuho had defeated a rival many times in succession, the latter, becoming desperate,
apologized for his rudeness and placed his stone on this spot, and Murase, nevertheless,
succeeded in winning the game, which was regarded as evidence of his great skill.
It has, however, been shown by Honinbo Dosaku that this move gives the first player
no decisive advantage, and I have been also told by some Japanese that the reason
that this move is regarded as impolite is because it is a wasted move, and implies
a disrespect for the adversary’s skill, and from what experience I have had in the
game I think the latter explanation is more plausible. At all events, such a move
is most unusual and can only be utilized by a player of the highest skill.
</p>
<p>When good players commence the game, from the first they have in mind the entire board,
and they generally play a stone in each of the four corners and one or two around
the edges of the board, sketching out, as it were, the territory which they ultimately
hope to obtain. They do not at once attack each other’s stones, and it is not until
the game is well advanced that anything like a hand to hand conflict occurs. Beginners
are likely to engage at once in a close conflict. Their minds seem to be occupied
with an intense desire to surround and capture the first stones the adversary places
on the board, and often their opposing groups of stones, starting in one corner, will
spread out in a struggling mass from that point all over the board. There is no surer
indication of the play of a novice than this. It is just as if a battle were to commence
without the guidance of a commanding officer, by indiscriminate fisticuffs among <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>the common soldiers. Of the other extreme, or “Ji dori Go,” we have already spoken.
Another way in which the play of experts may be recognized is that all the stones
of a good player are likely to be connected in one or at most two groups, while poorer
players find their stones divided up into small groups each of which has to struggle
to form the necessary two “Me” in order to insure survival.
</p>
<p>Assuming that we have advanced far enough to avoid premature encounters or “Ji dori
Go,” and are placing our stones in advantageous positions, decently and in order,
the question arises, how many spaces can be safely skipped from stone to stone in
advancing our frontiers; that is to say, how far can stones be separated and yet be
potentially connected, and therefore safe against attack? The answer is, that two
spaces can safely be left if there are no adversary’s stones in the immediate vicinity.
To demonstrate this, let us suppose that Black has stones at R 13 and R 16, and White
tries to cut them off from each other. White’s best line of attack would be as follows:
</p>
<div class="table">
<table class="gomoves">
<thead>
<tr class="label">
<td class="cellHeadLeft cellHeadTop cellHeadBottom"><span class="sc">White</span> </td>
<td class="cellHeadRight cellHeadTop cellHeadBottom"><span class="sc">Black</span></td>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="cellLeft">R 14 </td>
<td class="cellRight">S 14</td>

<td class="cellLeft">R 15 </td>
<td class="cellRight">S 15</td>

<td class="cellLeft">Q 16 </td>
<td class="cellRight">R 17</td>

<td class="cellLeft">Q 13 </td>
<td class="cellRight">R 12</td>

<tr>
<td class="cellLeft cellBottom">Q 12 </td>
<td class="cellRight cellBottom"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><p>
</p>
<p>and Black has made good his connection, or Black at his fourth move could play at
Q 14, then
</p>
<div class="table">
<table class="gomoves">

<tr class="label">
<td class="cellHeadLeft cellHeadTop cellHeadBottom">W </td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><p>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are other continuations, but they are still worse for White. If, however, the
adversary’s stones are already posted on the line of advance sometimes it is only
safe to skip one point, and of course in close positions the stones must be played
so that they are actually connected. The Japanese call this skipping of “Me” by the
terms “Ikken tobi,” “Nikken tobi,” “Sangen tobi,” etc., which literally means “to
fly one, two, or three spaces.” Although this is plain enough, these relations are
nevertheless shown on <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagrams <span class="asc">I</span>, <span class="asc">II</span>, and <span class="asc">III</span>. When stones of opposite colors on the same line are separated by vacant space in
a similar way (Diagram <span class="asc">IV</span>), then the terms “Ikken kakari,” “Nikken kakari,” etc., are used. “Kakari” really
means “to hang” or “to be related,” but as used in this sense it might be translated
“to attack.”
</p>
<p>Sometimes the stones are placed in relation to each other like the Knight’s move in
Chess. The Knight in Japanese is called “Keima,” or “the honorable horse,” and if
the stones are of the same color the relation is called “Keima” or “Kogeima,” “Ko”
being the diminutive. If the stones are of opposite colors, then the phrase “Keima”
or “Kogeima kakari” is used as in the previous case. The Japanese also designate a
relation similar to the Knight’s move, but farther apart, by special words; thus,
if the stones are one space farther apart, it is called “Ogeima,” or “the Great Knight’s
move,” and if the stone is advanced one step still farther, it is called “Daidaigeima,”
or “the Great Great Knight’s move.” On <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagrams <span class="asc">V</span>, <span class="asc">VI</span>, and <span class="asc">VII</span>, are shown “Kogeima,” “Ogeima,” and “Daidaigeima.”
</p>

</div><p>
</p>
<p>The next question that will trouble the beginner is where to place his stones when
his adversary is advancing into his <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>territory, and beginners are likely to play their stones directly in contact with
the advancing forces. This merely results in their being engulfed by the attacking
line, and the stones and territory are both lost. If you wish to stop your adversary’s
advance, play your stones a space or two apart from his, so that you have a chance
to strengthen your line before his attack is upon you.
</p>
<p>The next thing we will speak of is what the Japanese call the “Sente.” This word means
literally “the leading hand,” but is best translated by our words “having the offensive.”
It corresponds quite closely to the word “attack,” as it is used in Chess, but in
describing a game of Go it is better to reserve the word “attack” for a stronger demonstration
than is indicated by the word “Sente.” The “Sente” merely means that the player having
it can compel his adversary to answer his moves or else sustain worse damage, and
sometimes one player will have the “Sente” in one portion of the board, and his adversary
may disregard the attack and by playing in some other quarter take the “Sente” there.
Sometimes the defending player by his ingenious moves may turn the tables on his adversary
and wrest the “Sente” from him. At all events, holding the “Sente” is an advantage,
and the annotations on illustrative games abound with references to it, and conservative
authors on the game advise abandoning a stone or two for the purpose of taking the
“Sente.”
</p>
<p>Sometimes a player has three stones surrounding a vacant space, as shown in <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">VIII</span>, and the question arises how to attack this group. This is done by playing on the
fourth intersection. The Japanese call this “Nozoku,” or “peeping into,” and when
a stone is played <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>in this way it generally forces the adversary to fill up that “Me.” It may be mentioned
here also that when your adversary is trying to form “Me” in a disputed territory,
the way to circumvent him is to play your stones on one of the four points he will
obviously need to complete his “Me,” and sometimes this is done before he has three
of the necessary stones on the board. The term “Nozoku” is also applied to any stone
which is played as a preliminary move in cutting the connection between two of the
adversary’s stones or groups of stones.
</p>
<p>Sometimes a situation occurs as shown in <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">IX</span>. Here it is supposed to be White’s move, and he must, of course, play at K 8, whereupon
Black would play at K 7 (“Osaeru”), and White would have to play at L 8 (“Nobiru”),
and so on until, if these moves were persisted in, the formation would stretch in
a zigzag line to the edge of the board. This situation is called “Shicho,” which really
means “a running attack.” It results in the capture of the white stones when the edge
of the board is reached, unless they happen to find a comrade posted on the line of
retreat, for instance, at P 4, in which case they can be saved. Of course, between
good players “Shicho” is never played out to the end, for they can at once see whether
or not the stones will live, and often a stone placed seemingly at random in a distant
part of the board is played partly with the object of supporting a retreating line
should “Shicho” occur.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">X</span>, shows a situation that often arises, in which the White player, by putting his stone
at M 1 on the edge of the board, can join his two groups of stones. This is so because
if Black plays at L 1 or N 1, White can <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>immediately kill the stone. This joining on the edge of the board is called by the
special term “Watari,” which means “to cross over,” Sometimes we find the word “Watari”
used when the connection between two groups is made in a similar way, although not
at the extreme edge of the board.
</p>
<p>A much more frequent situation is shown at <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram XI. It is not worthy of special notice except because a special word is
applied to it. If Black plays at S 1, it is called “Haneru,” which really means the
flourish which is made in finishing an ideograph.
</p>
<p>We will now take up a few of the other words that are used by the Japanese as they
play the game. By far the most frequent of these are “Tsugu,” “Kiru,” “Nobiru,” and
“Osaeru.” “Tsugu” means “to connect,” and when two stones are adjacent but on the
diagonal, as shown in <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">XII</span>, it is necessary to connect them if an attack is threatened. This may be done by
playing on either side; that is to say, at Q 17 or R 16. If, on the other hand, Black
should play on both these points, the white stones would be forever separated, and
this cutting off is called “Kiru,” although, as a rule, when such a situation is worthy
of comment, one of the intersections has already been filled by the attacking player.
<a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">XIII</span>, illustrates “Kiru,” where, if a black stone is played at Q 12, the white stones
are separated. “Kiru” means “to cut,” and is recognizable as one of the component
parts of that much abused and mispronounced word “Harakiri.” “Nobiru” means “to extend,”
and when there is a line of stones it means the adding of another one at the end,
not skipping a space as in the case of “Ikken tobi,” but extending <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>with the stones absolutely connected. In <a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">XIV</span>, if Black plays at Q 9 it would be called “Nobiru.” “Osaeru” means “to press down,”
and this is what we do when we desire to prevent our adversary from extending his
line, as seen in the preceding diagram. It is done by playing directly at the end
of the adversary’s line, as shown in Diagram <span class="asc">XV</span>, where Black is supposed to play at Q 6. Here White must play on one side of the
black stone, but it must be pointed out that unless there is support in the neighborhood
for the stone used in “Osaeru,” the stone thus played runs the risk of capture. In
Diagram <span class="asc">IX</span>, explaining “Shicho,” we also had an illustration of “Nobiru” and “Osaeru.”
</p>
<p>If a stone is played on the intersection diagonally adjacent to another stone, it
is called “Kosumu,” but this word is not nearly so much used as the other four. Sometimes,
also, when it is necessary to connect two groups of stones instead of placing the
stone so as actually to connect them, as in the case of “Tsugu,” the stone is played
so as to effectively guard the point of connection and thus prevent the adversary’s
stone from separating the two groups. This play is called “Kake tsugu,” or “a hanging
connection”; <i>e.g.</i>, in Diagram <span class="asc">XIII</span>, if a white stone were played at Q 11 it would be an instance of “Kake tsugu” and
would have prevented the black stone from cutting off the White connection at Q 12,
for, if the black stone were played there after a white stone had been placed at Q
11, White could capture it on the next move.
</p>
<p>Passing from these words which describe the commonest moves in the game, we will mention
the expression “<span lang="ja-latn">Te okure</span>”—literally “a slow hand” or “a slow move,” which <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>means an unnecessary or wasted move. Many of the moves of a beginner are of this character,
especially when he has a territory pretty well fenced in and cannot make up his mind
whether or not it is necessary to strengthen the group before proceeding to another
field of battle. In annotating the best games, also, it is used to mean a move that
is not the best possible move, and we frequently hear it used by Japanese in criticising
the play.
</p>
<p>“Semeai” is another word with which we must be familiar. It means “mutually attacking,”
from “Semeru,” “to attack,” and “Au,” “to encounter,” that is to say, if the White
player attacks a group of black stones, the Black player answers by endeavoring to
surround the surrounding stones, and so on. In our Illustrative Game, <a href="#ch5.1">Number I</a>, the play in the upper right-hand corner of the board is an example of “Semeai.”
It is in positions of this kind that the condition of affairs called “Seki” often
comes about.
</p>
<p><a href="#plate13">Plate 13</a>, Diagram <span class="asc">XVI</span>, shows a position which is illustrated only because a special name is applied to
it. The Japanese call such a relation of stones “<span lang="ja-latn">Cho tsugai</span>,” literally, “the hinge of a door.”
</p>
<p>The last expression which we will give is “<span lang="ja-latn">Naka oshi gatchi</span>,” which is the term applied to a victory by a large margin in the early part of the
game. These Japanese words mean “to conquer by pushing the center.” Beginners are
generally desirous of achieving a victory in this way, and are not content to allow
their adversary any portion of the board. It is one of the first things to be remembered,
that, no matter how skilful a player may be, his adversary will always be able to
acquire some territory, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>one of the maxims of the game is not to attempt to achieve too great a victory.
</p>
<p>Before proceeding with the technical chapters on the Illustrative Games, Openings,
etc., it may be well to say a word in regard to the method adopted for keeping a record
of the game. The Japanese do this by simply showing a picture of the finished game,
on which each stone is numbered as it was played. If a stone is taken and another
stone is put in its place, an annotation is made over the diagram of the board with
a reference to that intersection, stating that such a stone has been taken in “Ko.”
Such a method with the necessary marginal annotation is good enough, but it is very
hard to follow, as there is no means of telling where any stone is without searching
all over the board for it; and while the Japanese are very clever at this, Occidental
students of the game do not find it so easy. Therefore, I have adopted the method
suggested by Korschelt, which in turn is founded on the custom of Chess annotation
in use all over the world. The lines at the bottom of the board are lettered from
A to T, the letter I being omitted, and at the sides of the board they are numbered
up from 1 to 19. Thus it is always easy to locate any given stone. In the last few
years the Japanese have commenced to adopt an analogous method of notation.

<p>Here the game is left as finished in the published report, but the remaining moves
are not all strictly speaking “Dame.” There are quite a number of moves to be made
before we can proceed to the count. The first question is, naturally, what stones
are dead, and we find that White has three dead stones at S 12, S 5, and K 4. Black
has three dead stones at J 15, O 4, and R 18. The white stones at P, Q, and R 13,
are not dead yet. They have aggressive possibilities, and must be actually surrounded.
As near as we can judge the game would proceed as follows:
</p>

<p>The frontiers are now absolutely in contact, and the count can be made, and it will
be seen that after filling up the vacant territory with the captured stones as far
as they will go, Black has won by three points. The Japanese would rearrange the board
in order to make the counting of the spaces more easy (“Me wo tsukuru”), but for the
first game or two the beginner might find it less confusing to omit this process.
</p>
<p><i>Honinbo Shuye comments on this game as follows</i>:

from a handicap.”

<p>This game is taken from Korschelt, and the notes are his. In some of these notes will
be found mere repetitions of matter that I have inserted in the preceding chapters,
or which will be hereafter found in the chapter on “Joseki.” These notes are, however,
very full and valuable, and a little repetition may have the effect of aiding the
memory of the student, and will do no harm. Contrary to the custom, this game was
played without handicaps.

E 5 would be cut off from the margin. Of moves that are good D 3–C 4 are the surest,

played. When two beginners play together the battle <span class="pageNum" id="pb81.1">[<a href="#pb81.1">81</a>]</span>moves slowly from a corner out over the board, and one side of the board is entirely

continuations similar to what we have shown in a preceding chapter.) Therefore, White’s
twentieth and twenty-second moves are merely intended to fill territory that would
otherwise fall to Black, and are not intended to form a new group.</td>

defense.

of strong players to apparently abandon a position to their adversary after first
preparing it so that eventually it may live, or so that it may afterward aid in surrounding
one of the adversary’s groups. The abandoned position often reawakens to life if the
weaker adversary allows his surrounding group to be itself surrounded and taken before
the capture of the abandoned position has been completed.<span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span></td>

<p>The stones that are still to be played are “Dame.” By playing these no “Me” can be
either won or lost, and for the most part it makes no difference whether they are
filled up by Black or White. These are as follows:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>O 15, N 16, H 5, H 6, F 13, E 13, H 5, H 15, F 10, E 13 E 12, H 15, F 10.

<p>Black has sixty-four “Me” and White fifty-seven “Me.”

<p>The game as published ends at this point, but there still remain moves to be made
that are not strictly “Dame.” White must kill the three black stones at E 8, F 8,
and G 8, <span class="pageNum" id="pb96">[<a href="#pb96">96</a>]</span>as that portion of the board is not quite disposed of, and “Seki” might easily occur
if White plays badly. The game might continue as follows:

<p>The following moves are strictly “Dame”: F 14, H 18, M 8, O 15, T 14. Either side
can fill these “Me.”
</p>
<p>The following stones are dead and can now be removed:
</p>
<p class="xd31e5448"><span class="sc">White.</span>—K 8, L 17, T 3, T 4. <br><span class="sc">Black.</span>—N 12, N 13, O 13, S 18.
</p>
<p>White wins by four stones. After the dead stones are used to fill up the vacant spaces,
and the board is rearranged, it will be found that White has fourteen “Me” and Black
ten “Me.”
</p>
<p>More than the usual number of moves were made in this game.

the “Sente” for Black; that is to say, a play which the opponent is compelled to answer,
or otherwise sustain too great a loss. Had Black played at S 14, White must have answered
at S 16, in order not to lose the stones at R 15–S 15, and also the corner, which
is worth about fourteen “Me.” To White’s play at S 16 Black would probably have answered
at R 12 and thus obtained a secure position.

<h2 class="main">“JOSEKI” AND OPENINGS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">From the earliest times the Japanese have studied the opening of the game. Especially
since the foundation of the Go Academy there have been systematic treatises on this
subject, and for keen and thorough analysis, these treatises have nothing to fear
from a comparison with the analogous works on Chess openings. There is, however, a
difference between the opening of the game in Chess and the opening in Go, because
in the latter case the play can commence in each of the four corners successively,
and therefore, instead of having one opening, it might be said that there are four.
</p>
<p>The Japanese masters usually overcome this difficulty by treating a corner separately,
as if it were uninfluenced by the position or the possibility of playing in the adjacent
corners, and in their treatises they have indicated where the first stones in such
an isolated corner can advantageously be played. These stones are called “Joseki.”
As a matter of fact, these separate analyses or “Joseki” differ slightly from the
opening of the game as actually played, because it is customary in opening the game
to skip from one corner to another, and the moment a few stones are played in any
corner the situation in the adjacent corners is thereby influenced. It is due to this
fact also that in their treatises on the “Joseki” the Japanese writers do not continue
the analysis <span class="pageNum" id="pb120">[<a href="#pb120">120</a>]</span>as far as we are accustomed to in our works on Chess. While this method of studying
the openings persists to the present time, one of the greatest of the Japanese masters,
Murase Shuho, compiled a series of openings which correspond more closely to our Chess
openings; that is to say, the game is commenced, as in actual play, all over the board,
and is not confined to the study of one corner as in the case of the conventional
“Joseki.” Korschelt, in his work on the game, inserts about fifty of these openings
by Murase Shuho, with notes that were prepared by the Japanese master especially for
the use of foreigners, and I have selected a few of these in addition to the collection
of “Joseki” which we will first consider.
</p>
<p>The work from which my “Joseki” have been selected was compiled by Inouye Hoshin,
and published in November, 1905. It was originally written for the “Nippon Shimbun,”
a newspaper published in Tokio. Of course, the annotations accompanying these “Joseki”
are not the original ones from the Japanese text. Many of the things which I point
out would be regarded as trite and obvious to a good player, and my annotations are
intended solely to aid beginners in understanding some of the reasons for the moves
given. It must also be understood that the series of “Joseki” which I have inserted
falls far short of completeness. In a Japanese work on the game there would be at
least five times as many.
</p>
<p>Although the “Joseki” have been studied by the Japanese masters from the earliest
times, it does not mean that the ordinary player in Japan is familiar with them; just
as in this country we find a majority of Chess players have a very limited acquaintance
with the Chess openings, so in <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>Japan many players attain a fair degree of skill without a thorough acquaintance with
the “Joseki.” It would certainly very greatly aid the beginner in attaining proficiency
if he were to study these examples, and follow them as nearly as possible in actual
play.
</p>
<p>It would seem to us that in compiling a work on “Joseki,” or openings, we would commence
with the openings where no handicap is given, and later study those where there were
handicaps; it is another instance of the divergent way in which the Japanese do things
that they do just the opposite, and commence their treatises with the study of openings
where handicaps are given. Inasmuch as this is a book on a Japanese subject, I shall
follow their example and shall commence the study of “Joseki” in games where Black
has a handicap.
</p>
<p>As we have already seen, the handicap stone is always placed on a certain fixed point,
which is the fourth intersection from the edge of the board in each direction, and
White has five recognized methods of playing his first stone in relation to such handicap
stone. These are called “Kogeima kakari,” “Ogeima kakari,” “Daidaigeima kakari,” “Ikken
taka kakari,” “Nikken taka kakari.” We shall take up examples of these in their order.

<p>Again Black has the better of it. He has a chance to <span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span>play at J 1 on the next move. The relation of this stone to the stone at F 2 when
at the edge of the board is called “Ozaru,” or the “great monkey,” and it generally
gains about eight spaces. This is also shown among the examples of end positions.

<p>Black has a good game.
</p>
<p class="tb"></p><p>
</p>
<p>We now come to the “Joseki” where no handicaps are given. In such cases, of course,
Black has the first move. The first stone is generally played on an intersection adjacent
to the point on which the handicap stone is placed when given. There are, therefore,
eight intersections on which the first stone might be played. In the lower left-hand
corner, for instance, these would be C 3, C 4, C 5, D 3, D 5, E 3, E 4, E 5. By common
consent C 3 has been rejected as disadvantageous for the first player, because the
territory obtained thereby is too small. E 5 has been rejected because it allows the
adversary to play behind it and take the corner. D 4, or the handicap point, is also
not used. The other six points may be divided into duplicate sets of three each, and,
therefore, there are only three well-recognized methods of playing the first stone.
These are: in the lower left-hand corner, C 4 or D 3, the most usual and conservative,
which is called “Komoku,” or the “little ‘Me’ ”; E 4 or D 5 which is <span class="pageNum" id="pb144">[<a href="#pb144">144</a>]</span>bolder, called “Takamoku,” or the “high ‘Me’ ”; and E 3 or C 5 which is not so much
used as either of the others, called “Moku hadzushi,” or the “detached ‘Me.’ ” We
shall give about an equal number of examples of each of these methods of opening the
game, commencing, as is customary in the Japanese works, with “Takamoku.”

<h2 class="main">THE END GAME</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A work on the game of Go would not be complete without a chapter especially devoted
to the subject of the end game.
</p>
<p>On the average a game of Go consists of about two hundred and fifty moves, and we
might say that about twenty of these moves belong to the opening, about one hundred
and fifty to the main part of the game, and the remaining eighty to the end game.
The moves which may be regarded as belonging to the end game are those which connect
the various groups of stones with the margin, and which fill up the space between
the opposing groups of stones. Of course, there is no sharp distinction between the
main game and the end game. Long before the main game is finished moves occur which
bear the characteristics of end game play, and as the game progresses moves of this
kind become more and more frequent, until at last all of the moves are strictly part
of the end game.
</p>
<p>Toward the end of the game it becomes possible to calculate the value of a move with
greater accuracy than in the middle of the game, and in many cases the number of points
which may be gained by a certain move may be ascertained with absolute accuracy. Therefore,
when the main game is nearing completion, the players survey the board in order to
locate the most advantageous end plays; that is to say, positions where they can gain
the greatest <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>number of “Me.” In calculating the value of an end position, a player must carefully
consider whether on its completion he will retain or lose the “Sente.” It is an advantage
to retain the “Sente,” and it is generally good play to choose an end position where
the “Sente” is retained, in preference to an end position where it is lost, even if
the latter would gain a few more “Me.”
</p>
<p>The player holding the “Sente” would, therefore, complete in rotation those end positions
which allowed him to retain it, commencing, of course, with those involving the greatest
number of “Me.” He would at last come to a point, however, where it would be more
advantageous to play some end position which gained for him quite a number of points,
although on its completion the “Sente” would be lost. His adversary, thereupon gaining
the “Sente,” would, in turn, play his series of end positions until it became advantageous
for him to relinquish it. By this process the value of the contested end positions
would become smaller and smaller, until at last there would remain only the filling
of isolated, vacant intersections between the opposing lines, the occupation of which
results in no advantage for either player. These moves are called “Dame,” as we have
already seen.
</p>
<p>This is the general scheme of an end game, but, of course, in actual play there would
be many departures therefrom. Sometimes an advantage can be gained by making an unsound
though dangerous move, in the hope that the adversary may make some error in replying
thereto. Then again, in playing against a player who lacks initiative, it is not so
necessary to consider the certainty of retaining the “Sente” as when opposed by a
more aggressive adversary. <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>Frequently also the players differ in their estimate of the value of the various end
positions, and do not, therefore, respond to each other’s attacks. In this way the
possession of the “Sente” generally changes more frequently during the end game than
is logically necessary.
</p>
<p>The process of connecting the various groups with the edge of the board gives rise
to end positions in which there is more or less similarity in all games, and most
of the illustrations which are now given are examples of this class. The end positions
which occur in the middle of the board may vary so much in every game that it is practically
impossible to give typical illustrations of them.
</p>
<p>Of course, in an introductory work of this character it is not practicable to give
a great many examples of end positions, and I have prepared only twelve, which are
selected from the work of Inouye Hoshin, and which are annotated so that the reasons
for the moves may be understood by beginners. The number of “Me” gained in each case
is stated, and also whether the “Sente” is lost or retained. To these twelve examples
I have added eight positions from Korschelt’s work.

<h2 class="main">PROBLEMS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the student has become familiar with the rules and the methods of play, and
perhaps has played a few games either with another beginner or with a Japanese master,
the impression left on the mind is likely to be that the game is too vague, and that
there is too wide a latitude of choice of positions where stones may be placed. This
impression might be corrected by the study of illustrative games, or of “Joseki” and
end positions, but such a course is rather dry and uninteresting, and, in the opinion
of the author, by far the best way of attaining a correct idea of the game is by means
of problems.
</p>
<p>Many of us are familiar with Chess problems, and I think Chess players will agree
that they benefit the student of Chess very little, because the assumed positions
are not such as arise frequently in actual play. The opposite is the case in regard
to Go problems. These are for the most part taken from actual games, and the typical
problem is a situation that is quite likely to arise in actual play, and some of them
are positions that occur again and again.
</p>
<p>If the student of the game will set up these positions from the text and attempt to
solve them, preferably with the aid and encouragement of some friend, he will find
that the task is an interesting one, and he will be impressed by the great accuracy
which is necessary in attacking and defending difficult positions.
</p>
<p>With the knowledge obtained in this way, he will be <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>able to judge with far greater skill what to do when a position is threatened in actual
play. He will be able to distinguish whether the danger is real, and whether it is,
therefore, necessary to reply to his adversary’s attack, or whether he can afford
to ignore it and assume the “Sente” in some other part of the board. He will also
be able to perceive when an adversary’s group is vulnerable so that it will be profitable
to attack it.
</p>
<p>The collection of problems which I have given in this book are rearranged from Korschelt’s
work, and they were in turn taken by him from a Japanese treatise called “Go Kiyo
Shiyu Miyo.” Necessarily the collection here given is a very small one, but if any
reader of this book becomes so much interested in the game that he desires to study
other examples, he will doubtless find some Japanese acquaintance who can supply him
with further material, as the Japanese literature of the game contains large collections.
</p>
<p>The most important kind of problems are those in which the question is how to kill
an adversary’s group, or how to save one’s own group when threatened. It is also often
very important to know how a connection between two groups can be forced.
</p>
<p>For greater clearness these problems are arranged under seven heads; to wit,
</p>
<p>1. <span class="sc">Saving Threatened Groups.</span>
</p>
<p>2. <span class="sc">Killing Groups.</span>
</p>
<p>3. <span class="sc">Playing for “Ko.”</span>
</p>
<p>The advantage gained by this operation is not apparent in the group itself, but depends
upon which player has the larger threatened group elsewhere.
</p>
<p>4. <span class="sc">Reciprocal Attacks or “Semeai.”</span>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is a combination of the first two kinds of problems, and it only differs from
them in that both players have comparatively strong groups which are so intertwined
that both cannot live, and the question is, which can kill the other first.
</p>
<p>5. <span class="sc">Connecting Groups.</span>
</p>
<p>The problem here is to force a connection between a small group having insufficient
“Me” and some larger group.
</p>
<p>6. “<span class="sc" lang="ja-latn">Oi otoshi.</span>”
</p>
<p>This really means a “robber’s attack.” It arises where a group is apparently engulfed
by the opponent, and when, by adding further stones to it which the opponent must
take, the threatened player can force his opponent to abandon a part of his surrounding
chain in order not to sustain greater losses. The attack is so sudden and unexpected
that the Japanese compare it to the methods of a highwayman. It is an example of the
finest play in the game.
</p>
<p>7. <span class="sc">Cutting.</span>
</p>
<p>This is another method of escape, and the problem is to cut off and kill part of the
adversary’s surrounding chain.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
